# Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Detecting Social Isolation from Unstructured Clinical Notes

This repository contains the code used in the paper “Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Detecting Social Isolation from Unstructured Clinical Notes”, which investigates transformer-based approaches for social isolation detection.

## Overview

The script performs:
- Text preprocessing and cleaning of clinical narratives
- Internal-External Cross-Validation (IECV) across three healthcare sites
- Fine-tuning of BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN-T5 for multi-class classification
- Evaluation using macro F1 score and detailed classification reports
